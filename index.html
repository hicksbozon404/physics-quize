    <!-- Chosen Palette: Academic Blue & Neutrals with subtle gradients -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as an interactive exam simulator with four distinct sections: 'Reference Tables', 'Units & Measurements', 'Dimensions', and 'Vectors & Scalars'. This task-oriented design is chosen for optimal usability, allowing users to quickly access reference material or jump to specific exam topics. A sticky top navigation bar facilitates seamless switching between sections. Each question is presented on a visually distinct card with a toggle button to reveal detailed, step-by-step solutions. This interactive approach supports self-paced learning and immediate feedback, transforming a static exam into a dynamic and engaging study tool. Global 'Reveal All' and 'Reset' functions provide convenient control over solution visibility. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Most questions are text-based with interactive 'show solution' toggles (Goal: Inform/Test, Method: JS toggle). For Question 8 (Vector Addition), a Chart.js scatter plot is used to visually represent the displacement vectors and their resultant, offering an intuitive graphical understanding (Goal: Visualize Relationships, Library: Chart.js/Canvas). All mathematical formulas are rendered using KaTeX for high-quality, clear presentation, replacing static LaTeX. New tables for SI prefixes and common physical quantities with their dimensions and units are integrated as static content in the 'Reference Tables' section, serving as quick lookup tools (Goal: Inform/Organize, Method: HTML Table). The design prioritizes clarity, interactivity, and responsiveness, ensuring all content is easily consumable and aids deep understanding. NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 1: Calculate the Nominal Volume (V)</p>
                            <p>The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given as $V = \\frac{\\pi D^2 L}{4}$. We will substitute the measured values of $D$ and $L$ into this formula.</p>
                            <div class="formula">V = \\frac{\\pi (1.250 \\text{ cm})^2 (15.24 \\text{ cm})}{4}</div>
                            <div class="formula">V = \\frac{\\pi (1.5625 \\text{ cm}^2) (15.24 \\text{ cm})}{4}</div>
                            <div class="formula">V = \\frac{74.96875 \\pi \\text{ cm}^3}{4} \\approx 18.7421875 \\pi \\text{ cm}^3</div>
                            <div class="formula">V \\approx 18.713501... \\text{ cm}^3</div>
                            <p><strong>Significant Figures Consideration:</strong> The length ($L$) has 4 significant figures (15.24 cm). The diameter ($D$) has 4 significant figures (1.250 cm). When multiplying or dividing, the result should be rounded to the least number of significant figures in the input values. In this case, both have 4 significant figures, so our volume should be rounded to 4 significant figures.</p>
                            <p>So, <strong class="text-blue-600">V \\approx 18.71 \\text{ cm}^3</strong> (rounded to 4 significant figures).</p>

                            <p>The relative uncertainty for a quantity $X$ with absolute uncertainty $\\Delta X$ is $\\frac{\\Delta X}{X}$.</p>
                            <p>Relative uncertainty for Length ($\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}$):</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">b) Practical Implications of Using Non-Standard Units:</p>
                            <p>Using non-standard or obscure units in scientific measurements has several significant drawbacks:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Global Communication Barriers:</strong> Science is a collaborative and international field. Standardized units, particularly the International System of Units (SI), ensure that scientific findings, data, and equations are universally understood and interpreted without ambiguity. Non-standard units create unnecessary hurdles for communication and data sharing across different research groups, countries, and disciplines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Increased Risk of Calculation Errors:</strong> As demonstrated in part (a), converting between non-standard units often involves multiple, complex conversion factors. Each step in such a chain introduces an opportunity for arithmetic errors, unit cancellation mistakes, or incorrect application of conversion ratios. This significantly increases the likelihood of inaccurate results.</li>
                                <li><strong>Loss of Physical Intuition and Scale:</strong> Scientists and engineers develop an intuitive understanding of the magnitudes represented by SI units (e.g., a Newton of force, a Joule of energy, a meter of length). When using unfamiliar units like furlongs or fortnights, this intuitive grasp of scale is lost, making it harder to estimate values, identify errors, or conceptualize the physical phenomena being described.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inconsistency and Complexity in Formulas:</strong> Fundamental physical constants (e.g., gravitational constant, Planck's constant) and derived physical laws are typically defined and expressed within a coherent system of units (like SI). Introducing non-standard units would necessitate re-deriving or adjusting these constants and formulas, leading to a fragmented and overly complex theoretical framework.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Reproducibility:</strong> For experiments to be reproducible, all parameters must be clearly and consistently defined. Non-standard units can lead to misinterpretations of experimental setups or results, hindering the ability of other researchers to replicate findings.</li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Why Precision is Crucial:</strong> The gravitational force between laboratory-sized masses is extremely weak. To detect and measure this tiny force, the experimental setup must be incredibly sensitive and stable. Researchers must be able to repeatedly measure the minute twist of a torsion balance with very small variations between measurements. If the measurements are not precise, the signal-to-noise ratio would be too low to extract any meaningful value for G.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Accuracy is Challenging:</strong> Despite high precision, achieving high accuracy for G is notoriously difficult. This is due to numerous systematic errors that are hard to eliminate or quantify:
                                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                                        <li>Subtle air currents within the vacuum chamber.</li>

                                        <li>Electrostatic forces between components (even if uncharged).</li>
                                        <li>Thermal gradients affecting the apparatus.</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    These systematic errors can cause the measured value to consistently deviate from the true value, even if the measurements themselves are tightly clustered (precise). Different laboratories, using slightly different setups, often obtain highly precise but slightly different values for G, highlighting the accuracy challenge.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Why Accuracy is Paramount:</strong> GPS relies on extremely precise timing signals transmitted from satellites to receivers on Earth. For a GPS receiver to accurately determine its position, it must know the exact time difference between the signals received from multiple satellites. Even a tiny inaccuracy in the satellite's atomic clock (which runs at nanosecond precision) would translate into significant errors in position.
                                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                                        <li>Light travels approximately 30 cm in one nanosecond.</li>
                                        <li>An inaccuracy of just a few nanoseconds in the satellite's clock would lead to positioning errors of several meters on the ground.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Therefore, the clocks on GPS satellites must be incredibly accurate, meaning their time measurements must be extremely close to a universal standard time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relativistic Corrections for Accuracy:</strong> To achieve this high accuracy, engineers must account for relativistic effects:
                                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                                        <li><strong>Special Relativity:</strong> The satellites move at high speeds relative to Earth, causing their clocks to run slightly slower (time dilation).</li>
                                        <li><strong>General Relativity:</strong> The satellites are in a weaker gravitational field than on Earth's surface, causing their clocks to run slightly faster.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    These effects, though seemingly small, accumulate rapidly. Without precise and accurate relativistic corrections, the GPS system would quickly become unusable. Here, being correct relative to a universal time standard is the most critical factor.</li>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Detailed Explanation:</p>
                            <p>Significant figures (or significant digits) are crucial in scientific measurements and calculations because they convey the precision with which a measurement was made and avoid implying a greater precision than actually exists.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Purpose of Significant Figures:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Indicate Precision:</strong> Significant figures communicate the reliability and precision of a measurement. The more significant figures a measurement has, the more precisely it is considered to be known. For example, a measurement of 5.2 cm implies less precision than 5.23 cm. The last significant digit is understood to be estimated or uncertain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid Misleading Information:</strong> When performing calculations with measured values, the result cannot be more precise than the least precise measurement used in the calculation. Significant figures ensure that the calculated answer does not falsely suggest a higher level of precision than the input data allows.</li>
                                <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> They provide a standardized way for scientists to report data and results, ensuring that the uncertainty inherent in measurements is properly conveyed.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How they reflect precision:</p>
                            <p>The number of significant figures directly relates to the precision of the measuring instrument used. For instance:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li>If a ruler can measure to the nearest millimeter, a measurement might be 12.5 cm (3 significant figures, precision to 0.1 cm).</li>
                                <li>If a Vernier caliper can measure to the nearest 0.01 cm, a measurement might be 12.53 cm (4 significant figures, precision to 0.01 cm).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The last digit in a significant figure is considered uncertain, reflecting the limits of the measurement.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Example of Misleading Conclusions:</p>
                            <p>Imagine you measure the length of a room as $10.2 \\text{ m}$ (precision to 0.1 m, 3 significant figures) and its width as $5.1 \\text{ m}$ (precision to 0.1 m, 2 significant figures).</p>
                            <p>If you calculate the area without considering significant figures, your calculator might give you:</p>
                            <div class="formula">Area = 10.2 \\text{ m} \\times 5.1 \\text{ m} = 52.02 \\text{ m}^2</div>
                            <p>If you report this as $52.02 \\text{ m}^2$, you are implying that you know the area to the nearest 0.01 m$^2$. However, your least precise measurement (width) only has 2 significant figures. The rule for multiplication/division states that the result should have no more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant figures.</p>
                            <p>The correct area, respecting significant figures, should be rounded to 2 significant figures:</p>
                            <div class="formula">Area = 52 \\text{ m}^2</div>
                            <p><strong>Misleading Conclusion:</strong> Reporting $52.02 \\text{ m}^2$ would be misleading because it suggests a precision that was not achieved in the original measurements. It implies that you are confident about the area down to the centimeter level, when your initial measurements were only reliable to the decimeter level. This could lead to overconfidence in experimental results or incorrect design specifications in engineering applications.</p>
                            <p class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 p-3 rounded-md">Significant figures are essential for accurately representing the certainty of scientific data, preventing overstatement of precision and ensuring reliable conclusions.</p>

                                    <p>When timing a pendulum swing, the reaction time of the person starting and stopping the stopwatch will vary slightly with each trial. Sometimes you might start too early, sometimes too late; sometimes stop too early, sometimes too late. These small, unpredictable variations lead to random errors in the measured period.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Method to Minimize Impact:</strong>
                                    <p>To minimize the impact of random errors, one should take <strong>multiple measurements</strong> of the same quantity and calculate their average. Random errors tend to cancel each other out over many trials, leading to an average value that is closer to the true value. For the pendulum, taking 10 or 20 swings and dividing the total time by the number of swings, and repeating this process multiple times, significantly reduces the effect of reaction time variability.</p>

                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Systematic errors are consistent, repeatable errors that cause measured values to deviate from the true value in a predictable direction (always too high or always too low). They are often due to faulty equipment, incorrect calibration, or flaws in the experimental design or procedure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> They affect accuracy. They cause a consistent bias in all measurements. They cannot be reduced by taking multiple measurements; they must be identified and corrected.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example: Measuring length with a miscalibrated ruler.</strong>
                                    <p>If a ruler is manufactured incorrectly and its first centimeter mark is actually 0.9 cm from the end, every measurement taken with that ruler will consistently be 0.1 cm longer than the true value.

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Principle of Dimensional Homogeneity:</p>
                            <p>The core principle of dimensional analysis states that for any physical equation to be valid, the dimensions on both sides of the equation must be identical. Furthermore, arguments of transcendental functions (like exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric functions) must be dimensionless.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 1: Analyze the Exponential Term</p>
                            <p>In the given equation, $x(t) = A e^{-bt} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, the term $e^{-bt}$ is an exponential function. For the exponential function $e^Y$ to be mathematically meaningful in a physical equation, its exponent $Y$ must be a dimensionless quantity. This means the product $bt$ must have no dimensions.</p>

                            <p>Time ($t$) is a fundamental physical quantity, and its dimension is simply $T$.</p>
                            <div class="formula">[t] = T</div>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 3: Solve for the Dimension of Constant b</p>
                            <p>Substitute the dimension of $t$ into the equation from Step 1:</p>
                            <div class="formula">[b] \\cdot T = M^0 L^0 T^0</div>
                            <p>To isolate the dimension of $b$, divide both sides by $T$:</p>
                            <div class="formula">[b] = \\frac{M^0 L^0 T^0}{T} = T^{-1}</div>
                            <p>This means that the constant $b$ has the dimensions of inverse time.</p>

                            <p>A quantity with dimensions of $T^{-1}$ is a frequency. In damped oscillations, $b$ is often related to the damping coefficient, which determines how quickly the amplitude of oscillations decays over time.

                                    <p>Dimensional analysis can only determine the relationship between quantities up to a dimensionless constant. For example, it can show that the period of a simple pendulum is proportional to $\\sqrt{L/g}$, but it cannot determine the constant $2\\pi$ in the formula $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{L/g}$. These constants must be found through theoretical derivation (e.g., solving differential equations) or experimental measurement.</p>

                                    <p>Dimensional analysis relies on the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which means all terms added or subtracted must have the same dimensions. It cannot derive equations that involve sums or differences of terms with different dimensional dependencies. For instance, it cannot derive an equation like $x = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$ because it cannot determine the coefficients like $1/2$ or distinguish between $v_0 t$ and $at^2$ if they were independent terms (though they have the same dimensions, their functional dependence on time is different).</p>

                                    <p>To use dimensional analysis effectively, one must already know or correctly guess all the physical quantities that influence the phenomenon in question.

                                    <p>The number of independent fundamental quantities (like M, L, T) limits the complexity of the relationships that can be derived. If there are more relevant physical quantities than base dimensions, dimensional analysis can only reduce the number of independent variables, not uniquely determine the exponents of all variables.

                            <p>A dimensionless quantity is a physical quantity that has no physical units associated with it. This means its dimension is $M^0 L^0 T^0$ (and also $A^0 \\Theta^0 N^0 J^0$ for other base units). Dimensionless quantities are often ratios of quantities with the same dimensions, causing the units to cancel out.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Significance of Dimensionless Quantities:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Universal Validity:</strong> Dimensionless quantities have the same numerical value regardless of the system of units used (e.g., SI, CGS, Imperial). This makes them universally applicable and useful for comparing phenomena across different scales or systems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scaling and Similarity:</strong> They are crucial in scaling laws and similarity principles, particularly in fluid dynamics and engineering. If two systems have the same values for all relevant dimensionless quantities, they are said to be dynamically similar.</li>
                                <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> They can simplify complex physical problems by reducing the number of variables involved.</li>

                                <li><strong>Angle (in radians or degrees):</strong>
                                    <p>Definition: An angle is typically defined as the ratio of arc length ($s$) to radius ($r$) ($ \\theta = s/r $). Since both arc length and radius are lengths, their ratio is dimensionless.</p>

                                    <p>Definition: The coefficient of friction is the ratio of the friction force ($F_f$) to the normal force ($F_N$) ($ \\mu = F_f / F_N $). Since both are forces, their ratio is dimensionless.</p>

                                    <p>Definition: The Reynolds number is a key dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics, representing the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. It's typically given by $Re = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\eta}$, where $\\rho$ is fluid density, $v$ is flow speed, $L$ is a characteristic linear dimension, and $\\eta$ is dynamic viscosity.</p>

                                    <p>Significance: The Reynolds number is critical for predicting flow patterns in different fluid situations. For example, low Reynolds numbers indicate laminar (smooth) flow, while high Reynolds numbers indicate turbulent flow. Its dimensionless nature allows engineers to scale experiments from small models to full-size systems (e.g., wind tunnels for aircraft design).</p>

The dot product naturally accounts for the fact that only the component of the force parallel to the displacement contributes to the work done.

                            <p>In physics, quantities are broadly categorized into scalars and vectors based on whether they possess direction in addition to magnitude.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Definition of a Scalar Quantity:</p>
                            <p>A <strong>scalar quantity</strong> is a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude (a numerical value and a unit) only. It does not have any associated direction in space.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Key Properties Distinguishing Scalars from Vectors:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Scalars have magnitude only; they do not have direction. Vectors have both magnitude and direction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> Scalars are added or subtracted using simple arithmetic rules (e.g., $2 \\text{ kg} + 3 \\text{ kg} = 5 \\text{ kg}$). Vectors require specific rules for addition and subtraction (e.g., triangle rule, parallelogram rule, or component method) that account for their directions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> When multiplying a scalar by another scalar, the result is a scalar. When multiplying a vector by a scalar, the result is a vector whose magnitude is scaled and direction remains the same (or reverses if the scalar is negative). The multiplication of two vectors can result in either a scalar (dot product) or another vector (cross product).</li>
                                <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Scalars are represented by a single number and a unit (e.g., $5 \\text{ m}$, $10 \\text{ kg}$). Vectors are typically represented by an arrow over a symbol ($\\vec{A}$), boldface type (<strong>A</strong>), or components (e.g., $5\\hat{i} + 3\\hat{j}$).</li>
                                <li><strong>Coordinate System Independence:</strong> The magnitude of a scalar quantity is independent of the choice of coordinate system. The components of a vector, however, depend on the chosen coordinate system, although the vector itself (its magnitude and intrinsic direction) does not.</li>

                                <li><strong>They have the same direction.</strong> This means they point in the exact same orientation in space.</li>

                            <p>It is important to note that vectors are "free vectors" in many physics contexts, meaning their starting point (or point of application) does not affect their equality.

                            <p>The scalar product, or dot product, of two vectors $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ is defined as $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{A}| |\\vec{B}| \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. Its geometric interpretation provides deep insight into its physical applications.</p>

                            <p>The dot product $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}$ can be geometrically interpreted in two equivalent ways:</p>
                            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Product of Magnitudes and Cosine of Angle:</strong>

Alternatively, it's the product of $|\\vec{B}|$ and the projection of $|\\vec{A}|$ onto $|\\vec{B}|$.</p>
                                    <p>Consider the projection of $\\vec{B}$ onto $\\vec{A}$: This projection has a magnitude of $|\\vec{B}| \\cos\\theta$. So, $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{A}| (|\\vec{B}| \\cos\\theta)$.</p>

                                    <p>This means the dot product quantifies how much of one vector "points in the direction of" or "is aligned with" the other vector.</p>

Only this parallel component of the force actually contributes to the work done. The component of the force perpendicular to the displacement does no work. For example:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li>If you push a block horizontally (force parallel to displacement), all your effort contributes to work. $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta = 1$, $W = |\\vec{F}| |\\vec{s}|$.</li>
                                <li>If you carry a book horizontally across a room (force upwards, displacement horizontal), the force you exert on the book is perpendicular to its displacement. $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta = 0$, $W = 0$. You do no work on the book against gravity.</li>

                            <p class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 p-3 rounded-md">The dot product thus elegantly captures the physical idea that only the "effective" component of a force (the part aligned with motion) contributes to energy transfer as work.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Detailed Explanation:</p>
                            <p>While most physical quantities are either true scalars or true vectors, some quantities behave differently under coordinate transformations, particularly reflections. These are known as pseudo-scalars and pseudo-vectors.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">True Scalars (Scalars):</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A true scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only and remains unchanged (invariant) under all coordinate transformations, including reflections (parity inversion).</li>
                                <li><strong>Behavior under Reflection:</strong> If you reflect your coordinate system (e.g., swap x to -x, y to -y, z to -z), the numerical value of a true scalar remains exactly the same.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Mass, temperature, energy, time, electric charge.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Pseudo-scalars:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A pseudo-scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only, but its sign (or value) changes under a reflection (parity inversion) of the coordinate system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Behavior under Reflection:</strong> If you reflect your coordinate system, a pseudo-scalar changes its sign.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example: Magnetic Flux ($\\Phi_B$)</strong>
                                    <p>Magnetic flux is defined as $\\Phi_B = \\vec{B} \\cdot \\vec{A}$, where $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field (a true vector) and $\\vec{A}$ is the area vector (a pseudo-vector). Since the dot product of a true vector and a pseudo-vector yields a pseudo-scalar, magnetic flux is a pseudo-scalar. If you reflect your coordinate system, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ changes direction, and the area vector $\\vec{A}$ also changes direction in a specific way, causing $\\Phi_B$ to flip its sign.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Other Examples:</strong> Magnetic charge (hypothetical), helicity (dot product of momentum and spin).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">True Vectors (Polar Vectors):</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A true vector (or polar vector) is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, and its components change sign under a reflection of the coordinate system in the same way as the coordinates themselves.</li>
                                <li><strong>Behavior under Reflection:</strong> If you reflect your coordinate system, the components of a true vector change sign (e.g., $x \\to -x$, $y \\to -y$, $z \\to -z$). The vector points in the reflected direction.</li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A pseudo-vector (or axial vector) is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, but its components do *not* change sign under a reflection of the coordinate system in the same way as the coordinates. Instead, they behave like a cross product of two true vectors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Behavior under Reflection:</strong> If you reflect your coordinate system, a pseudo-vector's components remain the same, but its direction effectively reverses relative to the reflected coordinate system. This is because they are typically defined by a "right-hand rule" which flips when the coordinate system is reflected.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example: Torque ($\\vec{\\tau}$)</strong>
                                    <p>Torque is defined as $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$, where $\\vec{r}$ (position) and $\\vec{F}$ (force) are both true vectors. The cross product of two true vectors results in a pseudo-vector. If you reflect your coordinate system, $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$ both flip their directions, but their cross product (and thus $\\vec{\\tau}$) maintains its original component values, effectively reversing its "handedness" or direction relative to the reflected space.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Other Examples:</strong> Angular velocity, angular momentum, magnetic field.</li>
